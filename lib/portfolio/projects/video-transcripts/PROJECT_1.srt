1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:01,910
The page builder platform.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:02,539
Okay.

3
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:09,319
This was , a request from a solar panel
company that operates worldwide, operates

4
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:16,360
a lot in the United States, a lot in
the EMEA region, and a lot in APAC.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:22,339
So they had this need of
offering to their installers.

6
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:27,069
The installers are third part companies
that sometimes they can be very

7
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,379
small, just one person operation.

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,540
Some installer companies are a little
bit bigger, but the installers buy solar

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,779
panels from this big solar company.

10
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:43,779
So they wanted to give to these installers
a marketing tool, a powerful marketing

11
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:49,869
tool so they can have a website, because
a lot of them didn't have a website.

12
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:51,649
Can you imagine?

13
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:58,000
So they wanted these installers to
have, a powerful, modern looking,

14
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:00,610
very nice, responsible everything.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,350
And then we built the platform.

16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:10,210
Yeah, we managed to talk with some of
the installers and talked with some

17
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,120
high hierarchy people in the solar.

18
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:16,195
Company and then we built
the whole ecosystem.

19
00:01:17,705 --> 00:01:21,785
The ecosystem itself, it's not so complex.

20
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:24,285
I built two web applications.

21
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:31,215
One is the editor that they can actually
sso into this web application from

22
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:34,255
another app that we also implemented.

23
00:01:34,315 --> 00:01:37,195
They can SSO into, they can choose.

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,480
Whatever components they
want to have on the page.

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,430
Some components are specific to
the installers, so they can, for

26
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:52,390
instance, they can have their own
text so they can add photos of the

27
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,950
installations that they have done.

28
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:01,180
So on one side, on part is that, and
some of the components are marketing.

29
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:03,835
From the solar panel company.

30
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:11,365
So it was a very win-win for them
because when the final customers entered

31
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:15,315
the installer company website that
they have created, they would see the

32
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:17,895
information about that specific installer.

33
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:23,415
But they would be seeing a lot of content
from the solar panel company about

34
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:26,475
their products, about how they operate.

35
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:28,785
It was really the strategy.

36
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:29,984
Over that.

37
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:34,665
So the system itself, okay, it
has these two web applications.

38
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:40,644
There is one rest, API built in node
in the middle that perform all the CRUD

39
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:42,464
operations that we need in this system.

40
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:45,105
It connects to a cloud sql.

41
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:50,644
There is in this diagram, and we have
some data streams that send the data to.

42
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:57,065
Big query for, just for reports
on Looker Studio and the reports.

43
00:02:57,115 --> 00:03:02,484
We can tell how many pages we have created
the last month , which country has.

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,500
Our pages created over time.

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,710
So we have basically, the whole
data into the BigQuery and then

46
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:16,670
the report team can build whatever
they want with this information.

47
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,940
And of course, without sensitive
information of course, but

48
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,800
the statistics and everything
are streamed to this BigQuery.
