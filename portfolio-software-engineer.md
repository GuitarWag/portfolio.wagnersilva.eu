**Slide 13: PROJECT 5 - Row-Level Security System**

**OVERVIEW:**
A major European coffee machine brand needed to embed Looker Studio reports on their customer portal, allowing each customer to see their own sales data, performance metrics, and analytics. However, Looker Studio's standard sharing model required users to have Google accounts and couldn't enforce row-level security for public links—creating a seemingly impossible requirement: public access with private data.

**BUSINESS CONTEXT:**
The coffee machine company had hundreds of B2B customers (cafes, restaurants, hotels) across Europe. They wanted to:
- Provide each customer with analytics dashboards showing their machine performance, sales data, maintenance schedules
- Embed these reports in the customer portal (seamless experience)
- Allow customers to access reports without creating Google accounts
- Ensure each customer ONLY sees their own data (strict data isolation)
- Support thousands of concurrent users during business hours

Traditional Looker Studio sharing options didn't work:
- **Private sharing:** Required Google accounts (friction for customers)
- **Public sharing:** Everyone sees same data (security nightmare)

A creative solution was needed to bridge this gap.

**CHALLENGE:**
- Looker Studio reports must be publicly accessible (no Google login)
- Each user must only see their own data (row-level security)
- Reports embedded in third-party customer portal
- Authentication context comes from embedding application, not Looker
- Must not show ANY data if user not authenticated in portal
- Scalable to thousands of concurrent users
- Zero data leakage between customers

**SOLUTION:**

**Architecture - Reverse Proxy with Secret Injection:**

**Flow:**
1. **Customer Portal (Embedding Application):**
   - User authenticates in customer portal (existing login system)
   - Portal generates JWT token containing user identity and customer ID
   - Portal embeds Looker Studio report URL with JWT as parameter

2. **Python Reverse Proxy (Cloud Run):**
   - Intercepts all requests to Looker Studio
   - Validates JWT token from embedding application
   - Extracts customer context (customer ID, permissions)
   - **Injects secret authentication parameters** into Looker Studio URL
   - Each customer has unique secret stored in secure mapping
   - Forwards modified request to Looker Studio

3. **Looker Studio Report:**
   - Connected to BigQuery data source
   - Uses URL parameters (injected secrets) in data source

4. **BigQuery Row-Level Security:**
   - Views with security filter: `WHERE customer_secret = @url_secret`
   - Each customer has unique secret in lookup table
   - Query only returns rows matching the injected secret
   - Automatic secret rotation for security

**Example:**
```
Customer A's JWT → Proxy injects secret_A123 → BigQuery filters to customer_A data
Customer B's JWT → Proxy injects secret_B456 → BigQuery filters to customer_B data
No JWT → Proxy rejects request → No data shown
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Python FastAPI application on Cloud Run
- JWT validation library (cryptographic verification)
- Secret management (secure key-value mapping)
- BigQuery parameter injection
- Comprehensive error handling:
  - Invalid JWT → 401 Unauthorized
  - Missing customer context → 403 Forbidden
  - Secret mismatch → No data returned
- Logging and monitoring for security auditing
- Auto-scaling for traffic spikes (0-100 instances)

**Security Features:**
- Cryptographically signed JWTs (tampering detection)
- Secrets never exposed to client
- Each customer isolated to their own data
- Automatic secret rotation (weekly)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Rate limiting per customer
- DDoS protection via Cloud Load Balancing

**IMPACT:**
- ✅ **Secure public reporting** without data exposure

**Slide 14: PROJECT 6 - Reusable SFTP Architecture**

**OVERVIEW:**
Two major global electronics companies (one German, one South Korean) needed to sync product registration data from their systems to enable post-sale marketing campaigns. Product registrations included payment information, requiring absolute zero data loss tolerance and high accuracy for financial reconciliation.

**BUSINESS CONTEXT:**
When customers register newly purchased electronics (TVs, appliances, etc.), companies capture valuable data:
- Product model and serial number
- Customer contact information
- Warranty registration details
- **Payment/purchase information** (for rebates, promotions)

This data needed to flow from the companies' SFTP servers to cloud infrastructure for:
- Marketing campaign targeting (post-purchase engagement)
- Warranty tracking and customer service
- Product performance analysis
- Financial reconciliation (payment data accuracy critical)

**Two separate clients, similar requirements, opportunity for reusable architecture.**

**CHALLENGE:**
- **Zero data loss tolerance** (financial/payment data cannot be lost)
- High-accuracy requirements for payment records
- Complex cross-infrastructure connectivity (corporate firewalls, allowlists)
- Multiple global clients with similar SFTP needs
- Different SFTP configurations (ports, auth methods, file formats)
- Same core data processing requirements (validate, transform, load)
- Deployments across different geographic regions
- File format validation and integrity checks
- Need for comprehensive error handling and recovery

**SOLUTION:**

**Reusable Architecture Design:**

**1. SFTP Client Library (Python on Cloud Run Jobs):**
- **Configuration-driven approach** (not client-specific code):
  - SFTP credentials (host, port, username, key)
  - File patterns to download (regex matching)
  - Schedule configuration
  - Validation rules
  - Error handling preferences

- **Comprehensive validation:**
  - File completeness checks (no partial downloads)

  ```
  /client-1/raw/YYYY-MM-DD/
  /client-1/validated/YYYY-MM-DD/
  /client-2/raw/YYYY-MM-DD/
  /client-2/validated/YYYY-MM-DD/
  ```

- **Validation stage:**
  - File completeness verification
  - Row count matches expected
  - Payment data accuracy double-check
  - Data format validation
  - Quarantine invalid files

**5. Dataflow Processing:**
- Parallel processing of validated files

**Slide 15: PROJECT 7 - Smart API Integration**

**OVERVIEW:**
A call center operations team needed real-time analytics on call data for performance monitoring, agent metrics, and customer service insights. However, the Pascom PBX system's API had severe limitations that made traditional integration approaches impossible.

**BUSINESS CONTEXT:**
Call center operations depended on timely data for:
- Agent performance monitoring (calls handled, average duration, customer satisfaction)
- Queue management (wait times, abandonment rates)
- Customer service quality tracking
- Capacity planning and staffing decisions
- SLA compliance monitoring

Real-time dashboards were critical for supervisors to make operational decisions, but the legacy Pascom PBX API created significant technical challenges.

**CHALLENGE:**
- **Pascom PBX API severely limited:**
  - ❌ No filtering capabilities (cannot filter by date/time)
  - ❌ No pagination support (cannot request specific page)
  - ❌ Returns ALL data on every API call (thousands of records)
  - ❌ No incremental sync capability
  
- Need near real-time call data (every 15-30 minutes) for analytics
- Must avoid loading duplicate records to BigQuery (cost + data quality)
- API rate limits required efficient use of calls
- Cannot impact operational PBX system (read-only, lightweight calls)
- Need to handle 10,000+ calls daily efficiently

**SOLUTION:**

**Smart Processing Pipeline with Hash-Based Deduplication:**

**1. Cloud Scheduler:**
- Trigger: Every 15-30 minutes (configurable)
- Frequency balanced between data freshness and API load

**2. Python Sync Job (Cloud Run Jobs):**

**Step 1 - Fetch ALL Data from API:**
```
API Call → Returns ALL call records (no filtering available)
Typical response: 5,000-10,000 call records (complete history)
```

**Step 2 - Timestamp Filtering (Local):**
```
Filter records: Keep only past 48 hours
Discard older records in memory
Reduces dataset: 10,000 → ~500 records (95% reduction)
```

**Step 3 - Hash Generation (Deduplication Key):**
```python
For each record, generate unique hash:
hash = md5(
    call_id + 
    timestamp + 
    phone_number + 
    duration + 
    agent_id +
    call_type
)

Example:
Call: ID=12345, Time=2025-01-15 10:30, Phone=555-1234, Duration=180s, Agent=A01
Hash: a3f5e89b2c1d4f7a...
```

**Step 4 - Deduplication Check (Query BigQuery):**
```sql
SELECT hash 
FROM calls_table 
WHERE hash IN (list_of_new_hashes)
```
- Returns hashes that already exist in BigQuery
- Compare generated hashes vs existing hashes
- Keep only records with NEW hashes (not in BigQuery yet)
- Example: 500 records → 50 new records (99% total reduction)

**Step 5 - Load to BigQuery:**
- Insert only NEW records (those with unique hashes)
- No duplicates possible (hash ensures uniqueness)
- Efficient bulk insert
- Automatic table creation if needed

**Efficiency Metrics:**
```
API Returns:         10,000 records (100%)
After 48h filter:       500 records (95% reduction)
After deduplication:     50 records (99.5% total reduction)
Loaded to BigQuery:      50 records (exactly what's needed)
```

**Hash Deduplication Benefits:**
- **Fast comparison:** Hash comparison much faster than full record comparison
- **Deterministic:** Same data always produces same hash (reliable)
- **Memory efficient:** Single string comparison per record
- **No external cache needed:** BigQuery is the source of truth
- **Self-healing:** Can safely re-run job anytime without duplicates
- **Idempotent:** Multiple runs produce same result (reliability)

**3. BigQuery Analytics:**
- Real-time Looker Studio dashboards
- Metrics: call volume, agent performance, queue wait times, SLA compliance
- Historical trend analysis

**IMPACT:**
- ✅ **Real-time call analytics** operational (15-30 min freshness)
- ✅ **80% reduced BigQuery insert costs** (only new records loaded)
- ✅ **Handles 10,000+ calls per day** efficiently
- ✅ **Scalable solution** despite severe API constraints
- ✅ **No duplicate data** issues (hash-based guarantee)
- ✅ **Can run as frequently as needed** without data problems
- ✅ **Self-healing architecture** (safe to re-run anytime)
- ✅ **99.5% data reduction** (10,000 → 50 records per run)

**Slide 18: PROJECT 10 - Real-Time CDC Pipeline**

**OVERVIEW:**
A support team using ZNUNY and OTRS (legacy) ticketing systems needed real-time visibility into ticket metrics, customer issues, and agent performance. However, analytics required BigQuery, while operational data was locked in MySQL databases.

**BUSINESS CONTEXT:**
Customer support operations relied on two separate MySQL-based ticketing systems:
- **ZNUNY:** Current primary ticketing system
- **OTRS:** Legacy system (still active, historical data)

Support managers needed real-time dashboards showing:
- Ticket volume and trends
- Response times and SLA tracking
- Agent performance metrics
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Issue categorization and patterns

Traditional batch ETL was too slow (data delayed by hours), and directly querying production MySQL would impact operational performance.

**CHALLENGE:**
- Two separate MySQL databases (ZNUNY and OTRS servers)
- Need real-time analytics on support tickets (not batch ETL)
- **Data minimization principle:** Only replicate necessary data (compliance + cost)
- Enhanced security for customer PII (don't replicate everything)
- Maintain data freshness for real-time reporting
- Handle schema changes automatically without breaking pipeline
- Cannot impact production database performance

**SOLUTION:**

**Architecture - Selective CDC with Datastream:**

**Source Systems:**
- ZNUNY MySQL Database (current support tickets)
- OTRS MySQL Database (legacy tickets, historical data)

**Datastream CDC Configuration:**

*Selective Table Replication:*
- **NOT** full database replication
- Only necessary tables selected:
  - `tickets` - Core ticket data
  - `customers` - Customer information (limited fields)
  - `agents` - Support agent data (limited fields)
  - `ticket_history` - Ticket lifecycle events
  - `ticket_categories` - Issue categorization

*Selective Column Replication:*
- **Data Minimization Achievement:**
  - `customers` table: name, email **ONLY** (NOT full address, phone, payment info)
  - `agents` table: name, email **ONLY** (NOT salary data, personal info)
  - `tickets` table: all columns (needed for analytics)
  - `ticket_history` table: filtered columns only (relevant events)

- **Result:** Only 40% of source columns replicated
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduced data transfer costs
  - Enhanced privacy compliance (less PII exposure)
  - Faster replication (less data to transfer)
  - Lower BigQuery storage costs

*Change Data Capture Features:*
- **Continuous replication** with sub-second latency
- **Automatic schema evolution** handling (new columns detected automatically)
- **Change tracking:** INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations captured
- **No impact** on source database performance (uses MySQL binlog)

**Target: BigQuery Dataset:**
- Automatically creates/updates tables to match source schema
- Real-time data availability (sub-second latency from source)
- Optimized for analytical queries
- Partitioned by date for query performance
- Clustered on frequently-filtered columns

**Analytics Layer (Looker Studio):**
- Real-time dashboards connected to BigQuery
- **Metrics:**
  - Ticket volume and trends (hourly, daily, weekly)
  - Response times (first response, resolution time)
  - SLA compliance tracking (on-time vs overdue)
  - Agent performance (tickets handled, response quality)
  - Customer satisfaction scores
  - Issue categorization trends

**Data Minimization Achievement:**
```
Total columns in source databases:    250+
Columns replicated to BigQuery:       ~100 (40%)
Sensitive fields excluded:             150+
Cost reduction:                        60% data transfer cost
Privacy improvement:                   Enhanced (less PII replicated)
```
