00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.069
Thank you so much

2
00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.370
for going through this entire
portfolio, it means a lot to me.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.930
I actually built this portfolio system
with the videos, the interactions, and the

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.845
slides so we could connect in a more deep
way on the subjects that I work on and

5
00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.425
how I thought about each solution that's

6
00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:18.895
presented here.

7
00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:23.905
I want to make it clear that I'm deeply
committed to move to Stockholm and build

8
00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:26.275
a life in this amazing city that I love.

9
00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:28.645
I do speak Portuguese,

10
00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:29.875
it's my native language.

11
00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:32.185
I am fluent in English.

12
00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:37.395
I speak very well Spanish, and
I'm learning Swedish and German.

13
00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:39.915
So I guess that's it.

14
00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:43.125
Hope you enjoyed your time
at this portfolio and,

15
00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:43.755
hej då!
