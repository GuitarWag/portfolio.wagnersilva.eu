00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.170
So we have this big solar panel
manufacturer as a client, and they

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.780
work alongside with installers.

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:14.154
These installers are third party
companies that sometimes can be

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:19.374
just a one person operation to a
big company with many employees.

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:24.974
This manufacturer wanted to use this
network as a marketing platform.

00:00:25.372 --> 00:00:30.532
So they needed a marketing tool that
would enable these installers to

00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:37.072
create web pages on the fly with their
localized data and also marketing

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:39.172
components from the manufacturer.

00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:41.106
So what was the solution?

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:47.916
We built a platform that was able
to deploy new websites in seconds.

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:55.206
These installers, they could just
SSO coming from another system

00:00:55.446 --> 00:01:01.416
from this manufacturer, and they
just landed into this editor

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:04.086
where they can choose components.

00:01:04.776 --> 00:01:10.296
From the solar manufacturer brand
with their custom marketing and all

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:16.896
the information, and also they could
localize putting their own content,

00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:21.971
their own text, their own images
of their own solar installations.

00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:26.741
They could also choose many languages
to support in the final app.

00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:29.517
This was a win-win solution
for the solar brand.

00:01:30.342 --> 00:01:35.382
Because every time the final customers
open the website created by the

00:01:35.382 --> 00:01:40.272
installer , all that marketing
content was delivered to the user.

00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:45.452
From the technical aspect, we built
two web applications with React.

00:01:45.812 --> 00:01:50.192
One for the editor and the other
one just to render the final

00:01:50.192 --> 00:01:52.622
pages in a more optimized way.

00:01:53.522 --> 00:01:58.692
There was a rest, API in the middle,
written in Node.js  with TypeScript

00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:01.742
that's running on cloud run.

00:02:03.242 --> 00:02:09.062
This API connects to a cloud SQL
instance that stores all the information

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:11.762
that we save within this application.

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:20.102
There's also a data stream that sends
data to BigQuery that can be used by the

00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:25.997
report team to get insightful information
about the usage of the application.
