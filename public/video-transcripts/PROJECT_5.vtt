00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.250
Okay.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.220
Row level security system.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.310
Okay, let me paint the picture here.

4
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.649
So this big customer in Germany
that we have, they have a client

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.099
of course, and this client is a big
company that makes coffee machines

6
00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.980
in the whole Europe, like they are,

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.280
I think they, perhaps
they're the biggest one.

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.540
I don't know, but yeah, I
think they are the biggest one.

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.745
So they had this manufacturer system
that they log in, the coffee brand,

10
00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:40.595
they log in and they see reports.

11
00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:44.585
They have many reports on Looker
Studio that they are all embedded

12
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.970
with iframe into this application
and they were using like Google

13
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.110
login for these reports don't be
like explicit on the internet.

14
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.980
But at some point it was not
working for their staff.

15
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.620
So they requested us to make these
reports to have a public link.

16
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.410
And with a public link, all the data
would be exposed to the internet.

17
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.280
So the challenge here was, okay, how do we
hide the data if somebody finds the link.

18
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.500
Then this project started, I
architected the whole connection

19
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.060
of things into the system.

20
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:37.060
Beginning in the embedding platform that
would inject JWT Token and I implemented

21
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.640
and I planned the reverse proxy.

22
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.250
This reverse proxy was written
entirely, it was written in Python

23
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.110
and would intercept the initial
request from our front end.

24
00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:57.384
With the JWT token, it'll
extract a lot of data,

25
00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:59.365
check if that user can check the report,

26
00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:05.695
it'll check what report we are talking
about, and then it'll fetch the

27
00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:12.325
secrets that we need to actually show
the data back in the Looker Studio.

28
00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:18.895
Because Looker Studio in this scenario
would be expecting

29
00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:22.105
the, would be expecting secrets as

30
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.610
params in the URL and then we inject all
the way through the queries in BigQuery.

31
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.030
So it's a whole system.

32
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.120
So the goal was, okay, at the end, if
there's no token in the URL in the

33
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.760
beginning, we shouldn't show data.

34
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.940
So this was perfectly implemented.

35
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.799
I provided a very high quality
documentation for the report team on

36
00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:56.000
how they proceed to actually adapt
every table or every report that

37
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.560
they wanted to have this feature.

38
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.710
And actually this feature was
replicated across other clients

39
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.840
from our customer in Germany.

40
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.330
So they were able to apply this strategy
to many brands, and they were very happy

41
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.845
because for the final customer,

42
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.470
they don't need to actually log
in with Google inside one platform

43
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.420
that they already have logged in.

44
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.000
So it was a strange situation.

45
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.430
So now it's seamlessly, like they
just enter the manufacturer portal

46
00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.280
and they see the data that they
need to see, and if the link of the

47
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.460
report leaks somehow, they, someone
guesses, no data is exposed whatsoever.
