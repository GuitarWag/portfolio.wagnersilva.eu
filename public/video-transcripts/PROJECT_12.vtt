00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.219
technical leadership.

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:11.230
So I spotted this project here
because it was done in 2025 and it

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.709
had a really good impact over the
organization that we worked with.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.250
So this was a project for a worldwide
foundation for conservation, and they

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.990
had a previous website for their.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.910
Roadmap 2030.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.599
So they have a an implementation
plan for conservation, for climate

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.029
change, its called Roadmap 2030.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.899
And this domain of knowledge.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.069
They had a previous website
that were, that was really bad.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.224
UX was bad, information was bad.

00:00:43.824 --> 00:00:47.110
There was no features, people
couldn't actually use the system

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.485
to get information about the
roadmap they were working towards.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:58.805
So our goal here was rebuild the
whole structure of the website,

00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:00.485
the site maps, all the feature.

00:01:01.064 --> 00:01:04.944
Based on the content the
framework that they were working.

00:01:04.944 --> 00:01:11.705
So it was a challenging subject because
I personally never had worked before.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:18.455
With this domain of knowledge, which
is climate change conservation, how

00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:25.935
conservation professionals work across
the entire world, how they peer, how they.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.190
Talk with each other.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.650
It was really insightful for
me being that environment.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.940
My role here was actual
leadership across teams.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.050
This foundation they had their team,
which was composed by a communication team

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.420
that was responsible for writing content.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.450
There was another person that
had knowledge about the practices

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.270
and how to actually connect with
conservation people on each country.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.240
And they had a leader of the project
itself, the, for the whole project.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.210
And my job here was work
as a middleman between.

00:02:06.975 --> 00:02:09.165
Their teams and our team.

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:17.364
Our team was a UI UX designer and
a copywriter that was reviewing

00:02:17.384 --> 00:02:19.445
and checking content on this.

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:26.405
So this whole process of developing
a site map and then on each page

00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:29.885
we have a different content and
this whole content interacts.

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:34.264
Like a graph because it's
all about one subject and the

00:02:34.264 --> 00:02:37.084
content itself, it's very deep.

00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:41.619
It goes from very high level objectives.

00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:48.624
That could be just one phrase, one
title into the very nitty gritty of

00:02:48.684 --> 00:02:54.114
specific indicators that are based
on calculations and numbers that they

00:02:54.114 --> 00:02:57.415
have, that are based on reports and
documents and PDFs and everything.

00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:04.384
The goal here was built a
beautiful UI that was meaningful,

00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:07.324
that was very easy to navigate.

00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:13.915
And then every person that would access
this system would be founding his way

00:03:13.915 --> 00:03:21.564
through this whole roadmap, when framework
that they are actually doing work about

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:27.024
climate change, about conservation
of the rainforest, things like that.

00:03:27.024 --> 00:03:30.144
So it was really insightful.

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:33.224
I had to travel to Geneve
for a few meetings.

00:03:33.584 --> 00:03:37.655
It was really important to be
there being with the high hierarchy

00:03:37.655 --> 00:03:39.575
of directors of this foundation.

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:46.665
Be able to speak expose my ideas
and suggest ways of work that would

00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:51.265
fasten this project of building
this website and make it happen.

00:03:51.265 --> 00:03:55.675
So we did, we worked three
months on this project.

00:03:57.145 --> 00:04:02.305
We built a very beautiful and insightful
SharePoint communication site from

00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:08.010
zero, from nothing, from empty canvas
that I bootstrapped a new website.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.300
And then we worked from there.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.220
We built everything.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:20.270
We added some type of technical things
on top of the basic build pages.

00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:26.975
I worked with Power Automate the
SharePoint lists in this case and

00:04:27.155 --> 00:04:34.445
Power BI to connect some source
of data that they had in the big

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:37.215
SharePoint ecosystem that they have.

00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:41.775
So they have, they had a lot of source
of information that needed to be.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.130
Ingested and transferred to new data to
be shown on real time reports in Power

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.190
BI that were embedded into the system.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.880
This internal communication site
has more than a hundred thousand

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.770
users, so they can now access the
system and interact and that's it.
