# PROJECT\_4

[00:00:00] GCP cost optimization. Yes. So for this big customer in Germany, we had this task a few years ago, five years ago or six, I don't actually remember where, when it started exactly, but we had this huge ecosystem that ran on premise and on a very old. Data center in Germany. So they were very worried that the hardware would fail and all their work would be destroyed actually.

So we started a very huge transfer of resources to Google Cloud back then. The goal back then was just make sure everything was secure, transfer to Google Cloud, implement the solutions and everything. So when was done, and after that we started to optimize in every time we could about costs and everything.

So [00:01:00] in the last round of the optimization, I was able to actually push some ideas that I had for this, all this period, and they were mostly all approved and I was able to make a very huge impact in their annual bill. So it was really nice. But most on this, most of the skill here is actually this active monitoring of the system, knowing how to put labels and everything.

So you can have a very granular. Response of how exactly this system is spending resources regarding money. So it's a project that I'm really proud of the impact that caused into the this company.
