1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
The three directional
real time sync project.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.390
Okay, so the same global solar company
that I also built the webpage builder.

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.700
They had these sources of data that
one of them was Pardot, Salesforce Pardot.

4
00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:20.505
The other one was Talent

5
00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:23.445
LMS, which is a LMS system

6
00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:30.240
for their process of certification
of these installers as they need

7
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.170
training to actually install
the solar panels in the houses.

8
00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.000
So they wanted to track
some information about this system.

9
00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:45.264
And then another internal
database that relates to another

10
00:00:45.264 --> 00:00:46.825
tool that we've built for them.

11
00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:49.665
So these two actually,

12
00:00:50.115 --> 00:00:54.585
it is about the process of
registering the projects that they

13
00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:59.265
have done in the houses, or even
sometimes it's commercial as well.

14
00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:04.665
So we had three databases that they
have shared information and they

15
00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:08.655
need to be in sync and sometimes

16
00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:13.275
one of these databases, they
would have new data that need to

17
00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:15.195
be replicated into the other two.

18
00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:20.934
So I've built a jobs mechanism
that runs over Cloud Run jobs.

19
00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:30.455
I think it has 12 or 13 actions that
they execute synchronously and they

20
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.020
perform the updates.

21
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.650
Every update is saved into Firestore
with before and after state snapshots.

22
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.070
So the people from the solar
panel company can enter into

23
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.100
admin system and check actually

24
00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:54.005
what information changed and they can
contact the support if they wanted that

25
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:56.495
to be reversed or corrected or anything.

26
00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:59.125
It doesn't happen much,
but it's a possibility.

27
00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.875
So we audit every aspect of this process.

28
00:02:04.105 --> 00:02:11.155
And one limitation here is that
none of these systems had real time

29
00:02:11.785 --> 00:02:13.735
events, like when data updated,

30
00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:16.015
just call an API.

31
00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:20.735
So I had to implement a system
based on Cloud Scheduler.

32
00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:27.745
So every 15 minutes something runs
in the system and detects which

33
00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:31.105
other workflow needs to run based
on the data that we collected.

34
00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:32.995
And so on.

35
00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:42.705
So there is one running mechanism in the
middle that acts as this real time event

36
00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:45.385
that these other systems they don't have.

37
00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:49.440
So this was the main challenge on
this, but it works really fine.

38
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.245
The costs are really low because the
images are very optimized and they

39
00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:55.625
run really fast for each workflow.
