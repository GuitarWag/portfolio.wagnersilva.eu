00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.060
GCP cost optimization.

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:02.590
Yes.

3
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:10.570
So for this big customer in Germany,
we had this task a few years ago, five

4
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.450
years ago or six, I don't actually
remember when it started exactly,

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.040
but we had this huge ecosystem that
ran on premise and on a very old

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.870
data center in Germany.

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:31.160
So they were very worried that the
hardware would fail and all their

8
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.840
work would be destroyed actually.

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.430
So we started a very huge transfer of
resources to Google Cloud back then.

10
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.630
The goal back then was just
make sure everything was secure,

11
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.510
transfer to Google Cloud, implement
the solutions and everything.

12
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:57.250
So when it was done, and after that we
started to optimize every time

13
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.410
we could about costs and everything.

14
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:07.480
So in the last round of the optimization,
I was able to actually push some

15
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.305
ideas that I had for this, all this
period, and they were mostly all

16
00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:16.495
approved and I was able to make a
very huge impact in their annual bill.

17
00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:18.625
So it was really nice.

18
00:01:18.675 --> 00:01:23.355
But most on this, most of the
skill here is actually this active

19
00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:27.705
monitoring of the system, knowing
how to put labels and everything.

20
00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:31.065
So you can have a very granular

21
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.540
response of how exactly this system
is spending resources regarding money.

22
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.140
So it's a project that I'm
really proud of the impact that

23
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.760
caused into this company.
