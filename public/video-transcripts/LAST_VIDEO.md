# LAST\_VIDEO

[00:00:00] thank you so much. To go through this entire portfolio, it means a lot to me. I actually built this portfolio system with the videos, the interactions, and the slides, we could connect in a more deeply way, on the subjects that I work for and how, I thought about each solution that's. Presented here. I wanna make it clear that I'm deeply committed to move to Stockholm and build a life in this amazing city that I love. I do speak Portuguese. It's my native language. I am fluent in English. I speak , very well Spanish, and I'm learning Swedish and German. So I guess that's it. Hope you enjoyed your time at this portfolio and, hej då!
