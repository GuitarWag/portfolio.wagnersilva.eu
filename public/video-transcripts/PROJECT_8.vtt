00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.000
CI/CD pipeline migration.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.840
So our biggest client in Germany,
they had this huge list of Jenkins

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:13.426
deployment configurations and a
single VM on their old data center.

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:18.901
And my function here was go
through build by build and transfer

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:21.031
all of them to Google Cloud build.

00:00:22.936 --> 00:00:27.016
So this was in the middle of
a process of a huge migration.

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:33.976
So some of the applications that I have to
rewrite the build process were also being

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:37.996
developed to run on a cloud environment.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:44.296
So it was not every time, it was not
just a task that I just needed to create

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:46.486
the sh file and just run it as it is.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:53.676
The whole process of build of each
individual application was analyzed

00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:58.756
and then was converted to be able
to run on cloud run back then.

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:05.056
Because when we did this, there was no AI
to help to debug big files like this and.

00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:08.931
Just build some bootstrap
files to work on it.

00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:11.571
So it was a whole manual process.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:12.983
Things that use it.

00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:16.833
A old MongoDB database that we
have back then they have to be

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:19.403
rewritten to connect to Firestore.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:27.493
That was the solution that we came up
with it and yes, so builds have changed

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:32.203
a little bit and I had to transfer
all of them, to this new environment.

00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:37.798
And of course I had to do for the
production environment, for the

00:01:38.038 --> 00:01:42.148
staging environment, and for the
development environment that we have.

00:01:42.148 --> 00:01:48.094
So not all went through all three
environments, but yes, staging

00:01:48.244 --> 00:01:50.494
and production, they were heavy.
