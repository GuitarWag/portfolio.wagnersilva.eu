# PROJECT\_12

**Wagner:** [00:00:00] technical leadership. So I spotted this project here because it was done in 2025 and it had a really good impact over the organization that we worked with. So this was a project for a worldwide foundation for conservation, and they had a previous website for their. Roadmap 2030. So they have a an implementation plan for conservation, for climate change, its called Roadmap 2030.

And this domain of knowledge. They had a previous website that were, that was really bad. UX was bad, information was bad. There was no features, people couldn't actually use the system to get information about the roadmap they were working towards. So our goal here was rebuild the whole structure of the website, the site maps, all the [00:01:00] feature.

Based on the content the framework that they were working. So it was a challenging subject because I personally never had worked before. With this domain of knowledge, which is climate change conservation, how conservation professionals work across the entire world, how they peer, how they.

Talk with each other. It was really insightful for me being that environment. My role here was actual leadership across teams. This foundation they had their team, which was composed by a communication team that was responsible for writing content.

There was another person that had knowledge about the practices and how to actually connect with conservation people on each country. And they had a leader of the project itself, [00:02:00] the, for the whole project. And my job here was work as a middleman between. Their teams and our team.

Our team was a UI UX designer and a copywriter that was reviewing and checking content on this. So this whole process of developing a site map and then on each page we have a different content and this whole content interacts. Like a graph because it's all about one subject and the content itself, it's very deep.

It goes from very high level objectives. That could be just one phrase, one title into the very nitty gritty of specific indicators that are based on calculations and numbers that they have, that are based on reports and documents and PDFs and everything. The goal here was built [00:03:00] a beautiful UI that was meaningful, that was very easy to navigate.

And then every person that would access this system would be founding his way through this whole roadmap, when framework that they are actually doing work about climate change, about conservation of the rainforest, things like that. So it was really insightful. I had to travel to Geneve for a few meetings.

It was really important to be there being with the high hierarchy of directors of this foundation. Be able to speak expose my ideas and suggest ways of work that would fasten this project of building this website and make it happen. So we did, we worked three months on this project.

We built a very beautiful and insightful [00:04:00] SharePoint communication site from zero, from nothing, from empty canvas that I bootstrapped a new website. And then we worked from there. We built everything. We added some type of technical things on top of the basic build pages.

I worked with Power Automate the SharePoint lists in this case and Power BI to connect some source of data that they had in the big SharePoint ecosystem that they have. So they have, they had a lot of source of information that needed to be. Ingested and transferred to new data to be shown on real time reports in Power BI that were embedded into the system.

This internal communication site has more than a hundred thousand [00:05:00] users, so they can now access the system and interact and that's it.
