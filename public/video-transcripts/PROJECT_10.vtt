Real-time

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.009
CDC pipeline so this is a type of
a very common request from this big

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.599
customer that we have in Germany.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:16.769
They often want to move data from
deepest places in the infrastructure.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.359
Another infrastructure.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:25.049
Places onsite, places on premise, places
from third party services that they have.

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:33.399
So in this case, they have a few
servers running OTRS instances

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.259
for their ticket system.

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:37.999
So all systems run.

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:45.029
Now ZNUNY, which is a new version
of the, of OTRS and it's fully open

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:47.359
source and driven by the community.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:57.039
So the goal here was basically take the
databases from ZNUNY Connect to Google

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:03.279
Datastream, which is a service on Google
Cloud that acts as a replication manager.

00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:10.674
In between the MySQL database and
BigQuery, it can handle sorts of

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:17.574
different data sources and data targets,
in this case was MySQL to BigQuery.

00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:23.814
And the interesting fact about
Datastream and this specific

00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:25.724
this specific workflow is that.

00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:30.174
The report team can have access
to the data stream that I created,

00:01:30.654 --> 00:01:33.714
and they can choose what table.

00:01:34.014 --> 00:01:38.574
And within these tables they can choose
which columns they want to replicate.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.734
So it's very good.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:46.044
So they can control, they're like the
admin person that has access to this.

00:01:46.554 --> 00:01:50.844
They can control using the user
interface, which is very easy.

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:52.484
They can control.

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:59.624
Sensitive data to be out of BigQuery
for reporting and just select

00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:05.654
specific table specific columns to
be transmitted to BigQuery, and they

00:02:05.654 --> 00:02:07.549
can update that anytime they want.
